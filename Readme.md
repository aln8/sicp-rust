# sicp rust

This is RUST version of exercise of MIT SICP book.

For self learning purpose, not all exercises have been done. Also there might be extra implementation beyond exercises.

# how to use it

For benchmark test for ex1_21, ex1_24, I'm using nightly rustc

Other than that, just run `cargo test`, you can see all test running.

Go to `src/` you can see all exercise well organized based on chapter.
